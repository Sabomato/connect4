# connect4


The purpose of this project is to learn and apply concepts of software development, such as O.O.P (object oriented programming); state machines; G.U.I (graphical user interface) ,with no concern on the aspect of it, using JavaFX; observer pattern and the nuances of Java.

This project is a recreation of the tradicional game, connect4, with one additional feature: 
Every 4 turns, each player can play a game, a typing speed test or some simple mathematics. If he wins, gets a special piece, allowing him to remove a whole column of pieces from the game grid.
The players can also save the game at the current turn, and replay one of the last 5 games (currently disabled).
