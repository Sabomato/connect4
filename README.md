# connect4
This version of connect4 has one additional feature: 
Every 4 turns, each player can play a game, a typing speed test or some simple mathematics. If he wins, gets a special piece, allowing him to remove a whole column off the game grid.
The players can also save the game at the current turn, and watch a game that ended (currently disabled).

The game has a text interface and also a GUI, in which the aesthetics was not the focus. The purpose was to make it functional, and apply the observer pattern.

In this project, the object oriented programming paradigm was applied, as well as a state machine.
